Two million dollars and one hour: Can you design a new news org that doesnâ€™t shit the bed?
==========

Starting a news site is a balancing act: How can you achieve maximum editorial quality, awesome design, and kick-ass frontend apps (and the backend to support them), while having an infrastructure that doesn't go down, happy employees, an office space, and--eventually--achieve profitability?

*Spoiler alert*: We're totally not going to solve that in an hour.

But this session--like running a real business--is an exercise in managing the trade-offs, to figure out a strategy, and to achieve a balance that gets you moving towards profitability.

A few money rules
-----------------
* The Blackbeard Venture Fund has invested $2 million in your news startup. Each coin in the pirates purse you've been handed is worth $50,000.
* You have two years to get your company in the black: There is no series B round, there is no exit strategy other than simply actually making money.
* For this exercise we define "in the black" as self sufficiency, not actually paying the money back.
* That means, by the end of year two, you need to be able to generate enough money to at least cover your monthly costs.

A few ground rules
----------------
* This isn't _just_ about moving coins around. You also need to develop a site people care about: You need an editorial POV, a publishing strategy, + distro plans.




Some basic money guides
-----------------------
Hey: This is a room full of really smart people, and I bet you all have better ideas on some of this stuff (read: SERVER COSTS) than I do. But I did some basic blocking here.

* Benefits
  * fine benefits: multiply your salary lines by 30%
  * good benefits: multiply your salary lines by 40%
  * silicon valley benefits: multiply your salary lines by 50%

* Rent
  * Manhattan rent is around $65/square foot.
  * Portland, Oregon? $25/square foot.
  * Going virtual instead? Slack is $5 per head per month

* Servers (A lot of this pricing depends on what you're doing, obviously.)
  * A content-heavy site, without a lot of computing bells and whistles, served smartly, runs around $100/month per million visitors.
  * If you're running EC2 instances or Heroku Dynos--which you'll want to if you're doing any real computing (running news apps, building a custom backend or dynamic frontend, etc)--your pricing will be quite a bit different.

* Content
  * Going to go freelance? Reputable rates are (broadly) $250-500 a piece.
  * Obviously, there are plenty of places on the internet that pay less.
  * Less can mean free: but have a strategy for how that keeps up.
